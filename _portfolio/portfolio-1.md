As an AI master's student and a book lover, I found this project really interesting and enjoyable to work on. This small project allowed me to learn how to apply natural language processing and semantic search techniques to build an intelligent book recommendation system. It also serves as my personal assistant when I need to find a new book to read. Of course, it would be better if the dataset were larger and included more booksâ€”but it's just a start and a foundation to build upon.
